🚀 ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable,
production-ready machine learning pipelines. By decoupling infrastructure from
code, ZenML enables developers across your organization to collaborate more
effectively as they develop to production.

- 💼 ZenML gives data scientists the freedom to fully focus on modeling and
experimentation while writing code that is production-ready from the get-go.

- 👨‍💻 ZenML empowers ML engineers to take ownership of the entire ML lifecycle
  end-to-end. Adopting ZenML means fewer handover points and more visibility on
  what is happening in your organization.

- 🛫 ZenML enables MLOps infrastructure experts to define, deploy, and manage
sophisticated production environments that are easy to use for colleagues.

![The long journey from experimentation to production.](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/intro-zenml-overview.png)

ZenML provides a user-friendly syntax designed for ML workflows, compatible with
any cloud or tool. It enables centralized pipeline management, enabling
developers to write code once and effortlessly deploy it to various
infrastructures.

# 🤸 Quickstart
Open in your browser file which called "index.html". 
It will load the remaining files.

# 🖼️ Using

ZenML allows you to create and manage your own MLOps platform using 
best-in-class open-source and cloud-based technologies. Here is an example of 
how you could set this up for your team:

## 🔋 1. Deploy ZenML

For full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to
enable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.

![ZenML Architecture Diagram.](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/Scenario3.png)

Currently, there are two main options to deploy ZenML:

- **ZenML Cloud**: With [ZenML Cloud](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-cloud), 
you can utilize a control plane to create ZenML servers, also known as tenants. 
These tenants are managed and maintained by ZenML's dedicated team, alleviating 
the burden of server management from your end. 

- **Self-hosted deployment**: Alternatively, you have the flexibility to [deploy 
ZenML on your own self-hosted environment](https://docs.zenml.io/deploying-zenml/zenml-self-hosted). 
This can be achieved through various methods, including using our CLI, Docker, 
Helm, or HuggingFace Spaces.

## 👨‍🍳 2. Deploy Stack Components

ZenML boasts a ton of [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) into 
popular MLOps tools. The [ZenML Stack](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide/understand-stacks) 
concept ensures that these tools work nicely together, therefore bringing
structure and standardization into the MLOps workflow.

Deploying and configuring this is super easy with ZenML. For **AWS**, this might 
look a bit like this

```bash
```

When you run a pipeline with this stack set, it will be running on your deployed
Kubernetes cluster.

You can also [deploy your own tooling manually](https://docs.zenml.io/stacks-and-components/stack-deployment).

## 🏇 3. Create a Pipeline

Here's an example of a hello world ZenML pipeline in code:

```python
```

```bash
```

## 👭 4. Start the Dashboard

Open up the ZenML dashboard using this command.

```bash
```

# 🗺 Roadmap

ZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a
regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where
the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.

ZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company#CompanyTeam) of
developers that are responsible for making key decisions and incorporating
feedback from the community. The team oversees feedback via various channels,
and you can directly influence the roadmap as follows:

- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion
  board](https://zenml.io/discussion).
- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).
- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our
  GitHub repo.
